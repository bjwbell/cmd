package obj

// An As denotes an assembler opcode.
// There are some portable opcodes, declared here in package obj,
// that are common to all architectures.
// However, the majority of opcodes are arch-specific
// and are declared in their respective architecture's subpackage.
type As int16

// Prog.as opcodes.
// These are the portable opcodes, common to all architectures.
// Each architecture defines many more arch-specific opcodes,
// with values starting at A_ARCHSPECIFIC.
// Each architecture adds an offset to this so each machine has
// distinct space for its instructions. The offset is a power of
// two so it can be masked to return to origin zero.
// See the definitions of ABase386 etc.
